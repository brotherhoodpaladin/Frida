# Frida
Nord Follower for Skyrim SE

[Frida Follower with CBBE and CBP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17541)

## Introduction

This is an update to the original mod done by Dorigong with permission. I really liked the look of the npc, but wanted to update her with physics, and clean up some of her details. I asked for permission from Dorigong and was graciously granted permission to use her work. The original mod and some additional details can be found here: Frida Follower and Mjoll Replacer. This is version 1 of that mod.
